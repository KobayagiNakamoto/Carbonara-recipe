Let's start with the first step:
04:42
we're separating the yolk from the albumen. We'll keep a yolk every 50 gr of pasta.
04:50
Second step: we're mixing Parmesan with Pecorino for the principle of not
04:55
increasing saltiness, as Carbonara is a dish with basic
04:59
ingredients that are very salty, with a strong saltiness, Pecorino
05:04
and guanciale, as well. For every 50 gr pasta, it's 30 gr Parmesan and 20 gr Pecorino.
05:10
Black pepper in grains, quite coarsely grinded, and we're now
05:16
creating our mixture, helping ourselves with a whisk.
05:20
We have two options: first, cold and outside the flame, and another option
05:27
I recommend is to make it bain-marie to pasteurise
05:32
the eggs well, at a temperature of around 60-62°C, creating
05:38
our famous salted zabaione. Once we're done with this, we're leaving the compound
05:43
aside to start cutting the guanciale. We're removing the black part, covered in pepper
05:50
and the lard, creating 1 cm per 1 cm cubes.
05:56
When cutting the guanciale, it's very important to keep the fat part.
05:59
We'll be using it later to thicken
06:03
our spaghetti with the egg cream. Hot skillet and guanciale. It's important
06:08
the guanciale cooks in its fat, so we're straining it just at the end,
06:12
when it'll be completely browned on the outside and soft on the inside.
06:16
We're lightly salting our water, just a pinch of salt
06:20
to fix the colour of pasta we're throwing.
06:24
We don't need the water to come to a boil,
06:27
the water just needs to reach a temperature of 90°C. Once we throw the pasta, we're adding
06:31
our guanciale and letting it stand, this way, with a spoon under the skillet
06:35
to let the fat drip down on a single side.
06:39
Our guanciale will stay crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.
06:43
Once pasta is cooked, we're taking our salted zabaione and draw it near
06:48
our boiling water. We're straining our spaghetti. A bit of fat
06:54
from the guanciale, some cooking water. Let's first thicken it outside the flame,
07:06
finishing it lightly on a bain-marie, adding our guanciale
07:10
we previously strained and cooled down. Let's move it away from the flame and finish
07:17
the thickening. We can now dish our Carbonara up.
07:30
Cheese. And pepper.
07:35
And here's my Carbonara!
